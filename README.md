A really weird assignment for me I did not really get what needed to be achived till like 1500 on the Friday and once I did I realised it was quite straightforward. I made a version on the Friday in about 3 hrs and was content. I then started applying the tools to my own project since that was alot more interesting. In doing that this project kind of fell out - just needed a reskin the database info - 10 mins of work to get Chat GPT to make the data and fill it in. I submitted this one because it was better. I spent more time trying to get this to launch on render than I did on the actual project itself. I found this project quite boring and similar to week 2 I will take what I have learnt and apply it to my own personal project - e.g. I have not put any authroisation in this one however in my personal one I have a table which assigns a unique ID to the user when you submit data and only that user can delete the post, Which uses joins. Which I would not have been able to achieve without learning the tools.
